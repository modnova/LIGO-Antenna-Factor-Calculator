# LIGO-Antenna-Factor-Calculator

This applet can be used to calculate the Antenna Factors for any detector and source. The application calculates the configuration of the gravitational wave for both the plus and cross configuration. The application does this by taking the source(here they are magnetars) and detector inputs and calculates new coordinates for the magnetar as a function of time and converts it to the detector coordinate system where the angles for the antenna factor is then calculated.
